Phase 1 — Auth and teams
Goal. Someone signs in, belongs to a team, and lands somewhere that belongs
to that team, in the theme they prefer.
Sign-in itself is already scaffolded. This phase is about what has to be true
around it
Build
Organizations. Signing in for the first time lands the person inside one
without being asked to create it. There's a way to switch between them, and a
way to invite someone else into one. Accepting an invitation brings the person
to this app's login page.
The current organization is readable during server rendering, not only in
the browser.
Whichever sign-in methods are enabled all lead to the same place. Adding or
removing one is configuration, not a code change.
Signed-out visitors to a protected route get sent to the login screen before
anything renders.
A theme control with three states: follow the system, force light, force
dark. Written to the root element so the colour tokens key off it.
The application shell everything later renders inside.
Constraints
Identity is a token, and the token carries the organization. Everything
built after this decides what someone can see by reading that claim. Nothing
downstream should ever have to ask the identity provider a question at
runtime.
Use what the sign-in scaffolding already provides rather than rebuilding it.
If a hand-written login form appears in this phase, something has gone wrong.
One session system, not two. Whatever the database library's own setup
snippet installs for refreshing its own sessions comes out. Sessions belong to
the identity provider. Two things trying to own the same cookie and the same
middleware slot is a bug that presents as random sign-outs.
The database client carries the signed-in token. Nothing queries anything
yet, but the client has to be constructed so the token travels with every
request, because that's what makes the claims readable inside a policy later.
A client wired up anonymously looks completely fine until the first policy
exists, and then returns nothing.
Environment configuration fails loudly at startup if it's missing. A blank
value that produces a confusing error three screens later is worse than a
crash on boot.
Nothing here creates a table.
Acceptance check
Sign in on a brand new account with each method that's enabled. They all land
in the same place, and the account is already inside an organization without
having been asked to make one.
Invite a second account. Accepting the invitation arrives at the login page,
and signing in from there lands in that organization's workspace.
Read the current organization in a server component and render it. It's there
on the first paint, not after a client-side hydration.
Switch the theme, reload, the choice is still there. All three states work,
and forcing light while the system is dark actually wins.
Visit a protected route while signed out, get redirected to login. Confirm in
the network tab that the page's HTML was never sent.
Not in this phase
Any table. Roles beyond the defaults that come out of the box. Styling the
sign-in screen beyond making it match the rest of the app.
