# Atlas

The product decisions behind this build, written before it starts, with the reasoning attached. The reasoning matters more than the decision — you'll hit forks this doesn't cover, and you'll need to know which way the thinking was leaning.

Read the part you need before you build something. Don't read it all at once, and don't paste it into a prompt.

## What it is

Sign in with GitHub, paste a public repository URL, and get a map of it. Folders as boxes, imports as lines between them. Open a folder into its files. Select a file and see what it imports, what imports it, and what
breaks two levels out if it changes. Ask for an explanation and get a paragraph
written from that file and its real neighbours.

Then a panel where you can ask the repository a question and watch it look the
answer up. There is a brief paragraph about what the repository does and what is the acutal intended purpose that the repository/code project is trying to achieve. 

Another floating panel should be made which includes the executive summary of the repository inluding the following panes : 

1.System Health (In terms of the A, A-. B and so on), The health is checked by auditing documentation, activity, security, and testing standards. For the documentation check for a clear README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md license, and changelog. Further the system health looks for (Activity and Maintenance by reviewing recent commit frequency, open issue counts, and pull request velocity), Security and dependencies (scan lockfiles for outdated packages, vulnerabilities, and exposed secrets), Quality & Testing (verify that CI/CD pipelines pass, test run, and branch protections are enabled), take inspiration from tools like free githhub repo health checker. 

2.Modernization Efforts time required to change it into a more robust and a better infrastructure. 
3.Critical Risks: Scan for Exposed secretes, check for vulnerable dependencies, audit repository access and permissions, analzye code quality and licensing. 
4. Risk Heatmap: with dark rectangles signaling higher delivery risk, a composite of code coupling, change churn, and test coverage gaps. And as we hover over them we get the specific concern in each module, and the heatmap includes change services, webhook delivery, API Gateway, Auth and Idempotency, Card Vault, Ledger, Radar and Acquiror connectors. 

Make these panels visually appealing simple, cohesive and affective as if a professional executive is going to be using those. 



## The problem

Codebases now routinely contain code nobody on the team has read. An agent wrote
it, someone confirmed it worked, it shipped. That is a reasonable way to work and
it is not going to stop — but it accumulates structure nobody chose. Files that
import through three layers of re-exports. A utility forty files depend on. A
module nothing has referenced in months.

The questions that follow are structural. What is this file, what depends on it,
what breaks if it changes. Answering them today means reading imports one file at
a time and holding the results in working memory, which stops working at around
thirty files and stops being attempted at all somewhere past a hundred.

## Who it's for

A developer opening a codebase they didn't write — most often one they built
themselves with an agent, across many sessions, and can no longer hold in their
head.

They can read code fine. What they can't see is its shape.

And increasingly that isn't one person's problem. A team of four all shipping
this way inherits four sets of code nobody read, and the person who joins next
inherits all of it at once. So an analysis belongs to an organization rather
than to whoever happened to run it. A repository is mapped once and everyone
after that starts from the map.

This description is the test every feature gets measured against. When something
tempting comes up — a quality score, a rating, a review panel — the question is
whether the person described above wants it. Usually they don't. They want to
know what depends on this file.

## Why this hasn't stuck before

Codebase visualisation is not a new idea and the track record is bad. CodeSee
built close to this with real funding behind it and is gone. Sourcetrail ran for
years as a desktop tool and was archived. Any plan here has to account for that
rather than assume it away.

The most likely explanation: both were selling a map of a codebase the user had
already read. A map you could have drawn yourself is a nice-to-have, and
nice-to-haves lose. What changed is that people now ship code they have never
read, which turns the same artifact into something needed on a specific
afternoon for a specific reason.

The current generation of AI tools mostly work the other way round — hand the
repository to a model and let it describe the structure. That is much faster to
build, which is why there are many of them, and it is the approach this product
is deliberately not taking. The next section is why.

That's the bet. It is a bet, and it should be stated as one.

## The rule everything rests on

**Every box and every line comes from really parsing the code.**

The AI may explain and label. It may never decide that two files are connected,
and it may never walk the graph when arithmetic can do it instead.

The reason, bluntly: a dependency graph that is ninety percent right is worse
than no graph, because there's no way to tell which ten percent is wrong. The
moment a model is allowed to guess at an edge, every edge becomes a maybe, and
the product is a nice-looking picture.

Pressure to break this will come from two directions. "AI code analysis" pulls
toward letting the model reason about structure. Anything calling itself a code
tool drifts toward becoming a code reviewer. Both are refused.

## Scope

- Sign-in with GitHub, Google or email, for identity only. No repo scope, no
  token storage, public repositories only.
- Organizations. Every analysis belongs to one, people are invited into one, and
  what you can see follows from which one you're in. Default roles only.
- Parsing every file — imports, re-exports and dynamic imports become edges.
  `require()` as well, because a large amount of real code still uses it.
- A pluggable place for framework knowledge, so knowing what a Next.js route
  looks like never leaks into the parser itself.
- Fan-in and fan-out per file.
- The map: folders folding into boxes, expanding into files, selection,
  highlighting, and a detail panel.
- Blast radius and dependency chain, as arithmetic over the edge list.
- Explaining a file, with a cache that isn't optional.
- Labelling files that convention couldn't identify.
- Coverage reporting — how much of the repository was parsed, and why the rest
  wasn't.
- Live progress during parsing, because parsing a real repository is not
  instant.
- A chat panel answered by an agent that looks facts up rather than recalling
  them.
- A check on whether the AI ever names a file that doesn't exist.

## Out of scope, and why

Each of these is something a model will propose, because each of them sounds
like an improvement. The reason matters more than the refusal.


- **Letting the agent traverse the graph itself.** It picks a starting point and
  a direction; the same arithmetic that draws the canvas does the walk. If the
  model does the walking, invented structure comes straight back in.
- **Private repositories.** Requires a token that would then have to be stored.
  Not in v1.
- **Approximate routes.** If a route's method and full path can't both be
  recovered from the syntax, show nothing. A wrong route is the same failure as
  an invented edge.
- **Queues, containers, workers.** One deployable application. If a repository
  is too large to parse in a request, that is a limit to state honestly, not an
  architecture to build around.


## How it works

No folder names here — the structure is yours to choose. These are constraints
on behaviour.

**The parser is standalone.** It takes a directory path and returns files, edges
and a coverage report. It does not know the web framework exists, does not know
the database exists, and must run from a plain script with nothing else running.
If it can't run standalone, the layering is wrong.

**Framework knowledge is an adapter, not a branch.** Knowing that a file in a
particular position is a page is Next.js knowledge and belongs in an adapter. An
`if (framework === ...)` inside parsing code means the interface built to prevent
exactly that has failed.

**Graph calculations are pure functions** over a list of files and a list of
edges. No data fetching inside them, nothing to mock in order to check them.

**Identity is a token, and the token carries the organization.** Sign-in and
teams come from Clerk. Everything after that decides what someone may see by
reading the organization claim off that token. Nothing in the application asks
the identity provider a question at runtime.

**The database is Postgres on Supabase**, and access to it is a policy rather
than a check the application remembers to perform. Rows belong to an
organization, the policy reads the organization off the token, and that is the
whole authorization layer. The distinction matters: signing in from a different
organization should show the first one's rows are not hidden by the interface
but absent from the query.

**Row-level security is on by default, not per table.** An agent is writing
these migrations, and the two failure modes are not symmetrical. A table with
security enabled and no policy yet returns nothing, which is visible. A table
where someone forgot to enable it returns everything, silently. The second one
must be impossible rather than unlikely.

**Every AI call is traced and cached**, with the cache read inside the traced
function, so a cache hit appears as a recorded run containing no model call.
That's what makes the cache verifiable rather than assumed.

## The interface

A dense developer tool, not a dashboard. Small type, tight spacing, monospace for
anything that is a file path. Someone using this is scanning a lot of names at
once, and the layout should assume that rather than fighting it.

**Colour carries meaning or it isn't there.** Two things earn colour. Direction:
what flows *into* a file and what flows *out* of it are different colours,
because that distinction is the entire reason to look at an edge. And kind: a
file gets a colour for what sort of thing it is, with enough hues to separate a
handful of categories and no more. Everything else — surfaces, borders, body
text — is greyscale.

**The palette starts at four decisions.** One blue as the accent, for selection
and anything interactive. Green for incoming, amber for outgoing. Surfaces near
white in light mode, near black in dark. Everything else derives from those —
pick sensible values, keep them consistent, and don't ask about each one.

**Dark and light, and the user's choice wins.** Three states: follow the system,
force light, force dark. The choice survives a reload. Both palettes are real
palettes rather than one of them inverted.

**Nothing moves on its own.** Motion happens because something was clicked. No
ambient animation, no pulsing, no drifting graph.

**Anything derivable from the edge list is instant.** If an answer is arithmetic
over data the browser already holds, it appears immediately — no spinner, no
network request. Putting a spinner in front of a calculation teaches people to
distrust the fast paths, which are most of them.

**The shell gets built once.** Where the panels sit, and what each one is for, is
settled in an early phase. Later phases add to those panels; they don't rearrange
them. Specific placement lives in the phase specs.

## Where this is likely to go wrong

**Folding folders into readable boxes.** A large repository has to collapse into
something legible, and the threshold has to be solved for rather than guessed.
Expect at least one wrong answer here before a right one.

**Import resolution.** Path aliases, index files, re-exports. The risk isn't
failure — it's _silent_ failure. A repository built on barrel files loses most of
its edges and still renders a clean, confident, wrong picture. This is the one
place loud reporting wins over a tidy interface.

**Measuring whether the AI output is any good.** Reading a few outputs and
judging them fine is not measurement. The requirement is that answer quality
becomes a number; the method for producing that number is genuinely open at the
time of writing, and it is the least settled part of this plan.

## What has to be true before this ships

Not "it looks right". Specifics:

- Pointed at a known repository, five files checked by hand match what the
  parser claims they import.
- Coverage states what was skipped and why, and the number is believable.
- Signed in from a different organization, the first organization's rows do not
  come back from the query at all.
- Every table in the schema has row-level security enabled. Not most of them.
- An explanation never names a file absent from the repository, and that is
  demonstrated by a check rather than asserted.
- The chat panel shows what it looked up before it answers. An answer arriving
  with no lookups behind it is the exact failure this product exists to prevent.
